This section provides an overview of how you can use OpenAI models in EvaDB.


## Chat Completion UDFs

To create a chat completion UDF in EvaDB, use the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE UDF IF NOT EXISTS OpenAIChatCompletion
IMPL 'evadb/udfs/openai_chat_completion_udf.py'
'model' 'gpt-3.5-turbo'
```

EvaDB supports the following models for chat completion task:

- "gpt-4"
- "gpt-4-0314"
- "gpt-4-32k"
- "gpt-4-32k-0314"
- "gpt-3.5-turbo"
- "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"

The chat completion UDF can be composed in interesting ways with other UDFs. Please refer to the  [ChatGPT notebook](https://evadb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tutorials/08-chatgpt.html) for an example of combining chat completion task with caption extraction and video summarization models from Hugging Face and feeding it to chat completion to ask questions about the results.
