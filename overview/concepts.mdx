## User-Defined Function (UDF) or Function

User-defined functions are thin wrappers around deep learning models. They 
allow us to use deep learning models in AI queries.

Here is an illustrative UDF for classifying MNIST images.

```bash
!wget -nc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb/master/evadb/udfs/mnist_image_classifier.py
```

```python
cursor.create_function("MnistImageClassifier", true, 'mnist_image_classifier.py')
const response = cursor.df()
console.log(response)
```

That's it! You can now use the newly registered UDF anywhere in the query -- in the `select` or `filter` calls.

```python
let query = cursor.table("MNISTVideo")
query = query.filter("id = 30 OR id = 50 OR id = 70")

// Here, we are selecting the output of the function
query = query.select("data, MnistImageClassifier(data).label")
const response = query.df()
```

```python
let query2 = cursor.table("MNISTVideo")

// Here, we are also filtering based on the output of the function
query2 = query2.filter("MnistImageClassifier(data).label = '6' AND id < 10")
query2 = query2.select("data, MnistImageClassifier(data).label")
const response = query2.df()
```
