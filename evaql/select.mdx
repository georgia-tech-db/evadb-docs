## Select frames with predicates 

Search for frames with a car

```sql
SELECT id, frame 
FROM MyVideo 
WHERE ['car'] <@ FastRCNNObjectDetector(frame).labels
ORDER BY id;
```


## Search frames with a pedestrian and a car

```sql
SELECT id, frame 
FROM MyVideo 
WHERE ['pedestrian', 'car'] <@ FastRCNNObjectDetector(frame).labels;
```

Search for frames containing greater than 3 cars

```sql
   SELECT id FROM MyVideo
   WHERE ArrayCount(FastRCNNObjectDetector(data).label, 'car') > 3
   ORDER BY id;
```

## Select with multiple UDFs

Compose multiple user-defined functions in a single query to construct semantically complex queries.

```sql
   SELECT id, bbox, EmotionDetector(Crop(data, bbox)) 
   FROM HAPPY JOIN LATERAL UNNEST(FaceDetector(data)) AS Face(bbox, conf)  
   WHERE id < 15;
```
