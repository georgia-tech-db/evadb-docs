## Load video from filesystem 

```sql
   LOAD VIDEO 'test_video.mp4' INTO MyVideo;
```

-  **test_video.mp4** is the location of the video file in the filesystem on the client.
-  **MyVideo** is the name of the table in EvaDB where this video is loaded. Subsequent queries over the video must refer to this table name.

When a video is loaded, there is no need to specify the schema for the video table. EvaDB automatically generates the following schema with two columns:
``id`` and ``data``, that correspond to the frame id and frame content (in Numpy format).

## Load Video from S3

```sql
   LOAD VIDEO 's3://bucket/dummy.avi' INTO MyVideo;
   LOAD VIDEO 's3://bucket/eva_videos/*.mp4' INTO MyVideos;
```

The videos are downloaded to a directory that can be configured in the EvaDB configuration file under `storage:s3_download_dir`. The default directory is ``evadb_data/s3_downloads``.

## Load Image From Filesystem 

```sql
   LOAD IMAGE 'test_image.jpg' INTO MyImage;
```

Images are loaded similarity to videos, each tuple in an image table represents an image. EvaDB automatically generates 
the following schema with two columns: ``name`` and ``data``, that correspond to the image name and the image data.

## Load CSV 

To **LOAD** a CSV file, we need to first specify the table schema.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS MyCSV (
                  id INTEGER UNIQUE,
                  frame_id INTEGER,
                  video_id INTEGER,
                  dataset_name TEXT(30),
                  label TEXT(30),
                  bbox NDARRAY FLOAT32(4),
                  object_id INTEGER
            );

LOAD CSV 'test_metadata.csv' INTO MyCSV;
```
-  **test_metadata.csv** needs to be loaded onto the server using
   **LOAD** statement.
-  The CSV file may contain additional columns. EvaDB will only load
   the columns listed in the defined schema.
